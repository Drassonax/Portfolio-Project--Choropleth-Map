Choropleth Map App fetches JSON data from a remote source describing all US county borders and relevant education statistics for each county. This data is then used to create a map of the USA, complete with state and county borders. Each county's color is assigned according to the percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree (or higher). The user is able to mouseover each county to get a more detailed overview of that county's education statistics. This is accomplished using the D3 Javascript library.
